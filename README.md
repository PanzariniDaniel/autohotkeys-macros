## Custom macros for auto hot keys for my 60% keyboard

### How to put hotkeys and hotstrings into effect automatically every time I start my PC?

There are several ways to make a script (or any program) launch automatically every time you start your PC. The easiest is to place a shortcut to the script in the Startup folder:

- Find the script file, select it, and press Ctrl+C.
- Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then enter shell:startup and click OK or Enter. This will open the Startup folder for the current user. To instead open the folder for all users, enter shell:common startup (however, in that case you must be an administrator to proceed).
- Right click inside the window, and click "Paste Shortcut". The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.
